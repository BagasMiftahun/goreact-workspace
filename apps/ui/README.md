# UI

This is the UI application for the Nx Example workspace.

## Development server

Run `nx serve ui` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `nx generate component component-name --project=ui` to generate a new component. You can also use `nx g c component-name --project=ui` as a shorthand.

## Build

Run `nx build ui` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test ui` to execute the unit tests via Jest.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `nx e2e ui` to execute the end-to-end tests via Cypress.
